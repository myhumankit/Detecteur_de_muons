This project is an evolution of "CosmicWatch-Desktop-Muon-Detector" published by MIT.
see project description on .

here, the aim was to develop a version of the sensor to support a participatory science program, 
so that it could be taken on board a sailing boat during high-latitude measurement campaigns. 

This new version, developed by My Human Kit , has made it possible to produce and significantly improve the architecture of the sensor 
and its code:
- Evolution of the code so that it can both record data and display it on an OLED screen (whereas MIT proposed 2 different versions of the code). 
- Addition of a GNSS receiver to synchronize data and autonomously record the boat's position 
- Addition of a RTC module to retain date and time in the event of a power cut 
- Improved data display on screen
- Optimization of the detection algo 
- Creation of a python script for data analysis (not yet finished)
